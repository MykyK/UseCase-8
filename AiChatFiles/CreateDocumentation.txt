# Use Case App

## 1. Application Description

Use Case App is a user-friendly web application, designed with the modern framework React (version 18.2.0) and Redux for state management. The application presents a simple form for users to input their First Name, Last Name, Email, and a Message. This form is constructed intuitively to create an effortless user experience and improve user interactions.

Beyond user form input, the application uses Redux to store user data generated by the form component. This data is then elegantly presented in a table component that renders the user data. The application uses the "validator" library to ensure data integrity by validating and sanitizing the input strings before they are processed. This application is an exemplary demonstration of form handling and state management in React, making it an excellent resource for learners and experienced developers alike.

## 2. Installation / Running the Application Locally

To run this application locally, you will need to have Node.js and npm (which comes with Node.js) installed on your computer. If you do not have these installed, you can download them from the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

Once you have Node.js and npm installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine. Open a terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository, and run the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
```
*Replace "username/repository.git" with the actual repository URL.*

After cloning, navigate into the repository's directory:

```sh
cd use-case-app
```

Next, install the project's dependencies using npm:

```sh
npm install
```

Finally, you can start the application with the following command:

```sh
npm start
```

Your application should now be running locally on your machine.

To build the application for production, use:

```sh
npm run build
```

To run the tests, use:

```sh
npm test
```
```
Please make sure to replace "username/repository.git" with the actual repository URL. This README file is a placeholder and should be adjusted according to the specific needs of your application.
